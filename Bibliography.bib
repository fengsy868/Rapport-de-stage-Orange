abstract = "Abstract The paper reports on the capabilities of Monte Carlo scintillation light transport code OptiX, which is an extended version of previously introduced code Optics. Optix provides the user a variety of both numerical and graphical outputs with a very simple and user-friendly input structure. A benchmarking strategy has been adopted based on the comparison with experimental results, semi-analytical solutions, and other Monte Carlo simulation codes to verify various aspects of the developed code. Besides, some extensive comparisons have been made against the tracking abilities of general-purpose \{MCNPX\} and \{FLUKA\} codes. The presented benchmark results for the Optix code exhibit promising agreements. "
